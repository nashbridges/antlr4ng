     * generates code to check before subrules/loops and each iteration.
     *
     * <p>Implements Jim Idle's magic sync mechanism in closures and optional
     * subrules. E.g.,</p>
     *
     * <pre>
     * a : sync ( stuff sync )* ;
     * sync : {consume to what can follow sync} ;
     * </pre>
     *
     * At the start of a sub rule upon error, {@link sync} performs single
     * token deletion, if possible. If it can't do that, it bails on the current
     * rule and uses the default error recovery, which consumes until the
     * resynchronization set of the current rule.
     *
     * <p>If the sub rule is optional ({@code (...)?}, {@code (...)*}, or block
     * with an empty alternative), then the expected set includes what follows
     * the subrule.</p>
     *
     * <p>During loop iteration, it consumes until it sees a token that can start a
     * sub rule or what follows loop. Yes, that is pretty aggressive. We opt to
     * stay in the loop as long as possible.</p>
     *
     * <p><strong>ORIGINS</strong></p>
     *
     * <p>Previous versions of ANTLR did a poor job of their recovery within loops.
     * A single mismatch token or missing token would force the parser to bail
     * out of the entire rules surrounding the loop. So, for rule</p>
     *
     * <pre>
     * classDef : 'class' ID '{' member* '}'
     * </pre>
     *
     * input with an extra token between members would force the parser to
     * consume until it found the next class definition rather than the next
     * member definition of the current class.
     *
     * <p>This functionality cost a little bit of effort because the parser has to
     * compare token set at the start of the loop and at each iteration. If for
     * some reason speed is suffering for you, you can turn off this
     * functionality by simply overriding this method as a blank { }.</p>

     * The recognizer attempts to recover from single missing
     * symbols. But, actions might refer to that missing symbol.
     * For example, x=ID {f($x);}. The action clearly assumes
     * that there has been an identifier matched previously and that
     * $x points at that token. If that token is missing, but
     * the next token in the stream is what we want we assume that
     * this token is missing and we keep going. Because we
     * have to return some token to replace the missing token,
     * we have to conjure one up. This method gives the user control
     * over the tokens returned for missing tokens. Mostly,
     * you will want to create something special for identifier
     * tokens. For literals such as '{' and ',', the default
     * action in the parser or tree parser works. It simply creates
     * a CommonToken of the appropriate type. The text will be the token.
     * If you change what tokens must be created by the lexer,
     * override this method to create the appropriate tokens.

    /**
     * Compute the error recovery set for the current rule. During
     * rule invocation, the parser pushes the set of tokens that can
     * follow that rule reference on the stack; this amounts to
     * computing FIRST of what follows the rule reference in the
     * enclosing rule. See LinearApproximator.FIRST().
     * This local follow set only includes tokens
     * from within the rule; i.e., the FIRST computation done by
     * ANTLR stops at the end of a rule.
     *
     * EXAMPLE
     *
     * When you find a "no viable alt exception", the input is not
     * consistent with any of the alternatives for rule r. The best
     * thing to do is to consume tokens until you see something that
     * can legally follow a call to r//or* any rule that called r.
     * You don't want the exact set of viable next tokens because the
     * input might just be missing a token--you might consume the
     * rest of the input looking for one of the missing tokens.
     *
     * Consider grammar:
     *
     * a : '[' b ']'
     * | '(' b ')'
     * ;
     * b : c '^' INT ;
     * c : ID
     * | INT
     * ;
     *
     * At each rule invocation, the set of tokens that could follow
     * that rule is pushed on a stack. Here are the various
     * context-sensitive follow sets:
     *
     * FOLLOW(b1_in_a) = FIRST(']') = ']'
     * FOLLOW(b2_in_a) = FIRST(')') = ')'
     * FOLLOW(c_in_b) = FIRST('^') = '^'
     *
     * Upon erroneous input "[]", the call chain is
     *
     * a -> b -> c
     *
     * and, hence, the follow context stack is:
     *
     * depth follow set start of rule execution
     * 0 <EOF> a (from main())
     * 1 ']' b
     * 2 '^' c
     *
     * Notice that ')' is not included, because b would have to have
     * been called from a different context in rule a for ')' to be
     * included.
     *
     * For error recovery, we cannot consider FOLLOW(c)
     * (context-sensitive or otherwise). We need the combined set of
     * all context-sensitive FOLLOW sets--the set of all tokens that
     * could follow any reference in the call chain. We need to
     * resync to one of those tokens. Note that FOLLOW(c)='^' and if
     * we resync'd to that token, we'd consume until EOF. We need to
     * sync to context-sensitive FOLLOWs for a, b, and c: {']','^'}.
     * In this case, for input "[]", LA(1) is ']' and in the set, so we would
     * not consume anything. After printing an error, rule c would
     * return normally. Rule b would not find the required '^' though.
     * At this point, it gets a mismatched token error and throws an
     * exception (since LA(1) is not in the viable following token
     * set). The rule exception handler tries to recover, but finds
     * the same recovery set and doesn't consume anything. Rule b
     * exits normally returning to rule a. Now it finds the ']' (and
     * with the successful match exits errorRecovery mode).
     *
     * So, you can see that the parser walks up the call chain looking
     * for the token that was a member of the recovery set.
     *
     * Errors are not generated in errorRecovery mode.
     *
     * ANTLR's error recovery mechanism is based upon original ideas:
     *
     * "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs" by Niklaus Wirth
     *
     * and
     *
     * "A note on error recovery in recursive descent parsers":
     * http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=947902.947905
     *
     * Later, Josef Grosch had some good ideas:
     *
     * "Efficient and Comfortable Error Recovery in Recursive Descent
     * Parsers":
     * ftp://www.cocolab.com/products/cocktail/doca4.ps/ell.ps.zip
     *
     * Like Grosch I implement context-sensitive FOLLOW sets that are combined
     * at run-time upon error to avoid overhead during parsing.
