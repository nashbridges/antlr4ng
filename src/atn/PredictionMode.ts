     *
     *Computes the SLL prediction termination condition.
     *
     *
     *This method computes the SLL prediction termination condition for both of
     *the following cases.
     *
     * - The usual SLL+LL fallback upon SLL conflict
     * - Pure SLL without LL fallback
     *
     ***COMBINED SLL+LL PARSING**
     *
     *When LL-fallback is enabled upon SLL conflict, correct predictions are
     *ensured regardless of how the termination condition is computed by this
     *method. Due to the substantially higher cost of LL prediction, the
     *prediction should only fall back to LL when the additional lookahead
     *cannot lead to a unique SLL prediction.
     *
     *Assuming combined SLL+LL parsing, an SLL configuration set with only
     *conflicting subsets should fall back to full LL, even if the
     *configuration sets don't resolve to the same alternative (e.g.
     *`{1,2`} and `{3,4`}. If there is at least one non-conflicting
     *configuration, SLL could continue with the hopes that more lookahead will
     *resolve via one of those non-conflicting configurations.
     *
     *Here's the prediction termination rule them: SLL (for SLL+LL parsing)
     *stops when it sees only conflicting configuration subsets. In contrast,
     *full LL keeps going when there is uncertainty.
     *
     ***HEURISTIC**
     *
     *As a heuristic, we stop prediction when we see any conflicting subset
     *unless we see a state that only has one alternative associated with it.
     *The single-alt-state thing lets prediction continue upon rules like
     *(otherwise, it would admit defeat too soon):
     *
     *`[12|1|[], 6|2|[], 12|2|[]]. s : (ID | ID ID?) ';' ;`
     *
     *When the ATN simulation reaches the state before `';'`, it has a
     *DFA state that looks like: `[12|1|[], 6|2|[], 12|2|[]]`. Naturally
     *`12|1|[]` and `12|2|[]` conflict, but we cannot stop
     *processing this node because alternative to has another way to continue,
     *via `[6|2|[]]`.
     *
     *It also let's us continue for this rule:
     *
     *`[1|1|[], 1|2|[], 8|3|[]] a : A | A | A B ;`
     *
     *After matching input A, we reach the stop state for rule A, state 1.
     *State 8 is the state right before B. Clearly alternatives 1 and 2
     *conflict and no amount of further lookahead will separate the two.
     *However, alternative 3 will be able to continue and so we do not stop
     *working on this state. In the previous example, we're concerned with
     *states associated with the conflicting alternatives. Here alt 3 is not
     *associated with the conflicting configs, but since we can continue
     *looking for input reasonably, don't declare the state done.
     *
     ***PURE SLL PARSING**
     *
     *To handle pure SLL parsing, all we have to do is make sure that we
     *combine stack contexts for configurations that differ only by semantic
     *predicate. From there, we can do the usual SLL termination heuristic.
     *
     ***PREDICATES IN SLL+LL PARSING**
     *
     *SLL decisions don't evaluate predicates until after they reach DFA stop
     *states because they need to create the DFA cache that works in all
     *semantic situations. In contrast, full LL evaluates predicates collected
     *during start state computation so it can ignore predicates thereafter.
     *This means that SLL termination detection can totally ignore semantic
     *predicates.
     *
     *Implementation-wise, {@link ATNConfigSet} combines stack contexts but not
     *semantic predicate contexts so we might see two configurations like the
     *following.
     *
     *`(s, 1, x, {`), (s, 1, x', {p})}
     *
     *Before testing these configurations against others, we have to merge
     *`x` and `x'` (without modifying the existing configurations).
     *For example, we test `(x+x')==x''` when looking for conflicts in
     *the following configurations.
     *
     *`(s, 1, x, {`), (s, 1, x', {p}), (s, 2, x'', {})}
     *
     *If the configuration set has predicates (as indicated by
     *{@link ATNConfigSet//hasSemanticContext}), this algorithm makes a copy of
     *the configurations to strip out all of the predicates so that a standard
     *{@link ATNConfigSet} will merge everything ignoring predicates.

     *
     *Full LL prediction termination.
     *
     *Can we stop looking ahead during ATN simulation or is there some
     *uncertainty as to which alternative we will ultimately pick, after
     *consuming more input? Even if there are partial conflicts, we might know
     *that everything is going to resolve to the same minimum alternative. That
     *means we can stop since no more lookahead will change that fact. On the
     *other hand, there might be multiple conflicts that resolve to different
     *minimums. That means we need more look ahead to decide which of those
     *alternatives we should predict.
     *
     *The basic idea is to split the set of configurations `C`, into
     *conflicting subsets `(s, _, ctx, _)` and singleton subsets with
     *non-conflicting configurations. Two configurations conflict if they have
     *identical {@link ATNConfig//state} and {@link ATNConfig//context} values
     *but different {@link ATNConfig//alt} value, e.g. `(s, i, ctx, _)`
     *and `(s, j, ctx, _)` for `i!=j`.
     *
     *Reduce these configuration subsets to the set of possible alternatives.
     *You can compute the alternative subsets in one pass as follows:
     *
     *`A_s,ctx = {i | (s, i, ctx, _)`} for each configuration in
     *`C` holding `s` and `ctx` fixed.
     *
     *Or in pseudo-code, for each configuration `c` in `C`:
     *
     *```
     *map[c] U= c.{@link ATNConfig//alt alt} // map hash/equals uses s and x, not
     *alt and not pred
     *```
     *
     *The values in `map` are the set of `A_s,ctx` sets.
     *
     *If `|A_s,ctx|=1` then there is no conflict associated with
     *`s` and `ctx`.
     *
     *Reduce the subsets to singletons by choosing a minimum of each subset. If
     *the union of these alternative subsets is a singleton, then no amount of
     *more lookahead will help us. We will always pick that alternative. If,
     *however, there is more than one alternative, then we are uncertain which
     *alternative to predict and must continue looking for resolution. We may
     *or may not discover an ambiguity in the future, even if there are no
     *conflicting subsets this round.
     *
     *The biggest sin is to terminate early because it means we've made a
     *decision but were uncertain as to the eventual outcome. We haven't used
     *enough lookahead. On the other hand, announcing a conflict too late is no
     *big deal; you will still have the conflict. It's just inefficient. It
     *might even look until the end of file.
     *
     *No special consideration for semantic predicates is required because
     *predicates are evaluated on-the-fly for full LL prediction, ensuring that
     *no configuration contains a semantic context during the termination
     *check.
     *
     ***CONFLICTING CONFIGS**
     *
     *Two configurations `(s, i, x)` and `(s, j, x')`, conflict
     *when `i!=j` but `x=x'`. Because we merge all
     *`(s, i, _)` configurations together, that means that there are at
     *most `n` configurations associated with state `s` for
     *`n` possible alternatives in the decision. The merged stacks
     *complicate the comparison of configuration contexts `x` and
     *`x'`. Sam checks to see if one is a subset of the other by calling
     *merge and checking to see if the merged result is either `x` or
     *`x'`. If the `x` associated with lowest alternative `i`
     *is the superset, then `i` is the only possible prediction since the
     *others resolve to `min(i)` as well. However, if `x` is
     *associated with `j>i` then at least one stack configuration for
     *`j` is not in conflict with alternative `i`. The algorithm
     *should keep going, looking for more lookahead due to the uncertainty.
     *
     *For simplicity, I'm doing a equality check between `x` and
     *`x'` that lets the algorithm continue to consume lookahead longer
     *than necessary. The reason I like the equality is of course the
     *simplicity but also because that is the test you need to detect the
     *alternatives that are actually in conflict.
     *
     ***CONTINUE/STOP RULE**
     *
     *Continue if union of resolved alternative sets from non-conflicting and
     *conflicting alternative subsets has more than one alternative. We are
     *uncertain about which alternative to predict.
     *
     *The complete set of alternatives, `[i for (_,i,_)]`, tells us which
     *alternatives are still in the running for the amount of input we've
     *consumed at this point. The conflicting sets let us to strip away
     *configurations that won't lead to more states because we resolve
     *conflicts to the configuration with a minimum alternate for the
     *conflicting set.
     *
     ***CASES**

     *`{1`} U conflicting sets `min({1,2`)} U `min({1,2`)} =

     *
     * - `(s, 1, x)`, `(s, 2, x)`, `(s', 1, y)`,
     *`(s', 2, y)` yields conflicting, reduced sets `{1`} U
     *`{1`} = `{1`} => stop and predict 1, can announce
     *ambiguity `{1,2`}
     *

     *`{2`} = `{1,2`} => continue

     *`(s', 4, y)` yields conflicting, reduced sets `{1`} U
     *`{3`} = `{1,3`} => continue
     *
     *</ul>
     *
     ***EXACT AMBIGUITY DETECTION**
     *
     *If all states report the same conflicting set of alternatives, then we

     *
     *`|A_*i*|>1` and
     *`A_*i* = A_*j*` for all *i*, *j*.
     *
     *In other words, we continue examining lookahead until all `A_i`
     *have more than one alternative and all `A_i` are the same. If
     *`A={{1,2`, {1,3}}}, then regular LL prediction would terminate
     *because the resolved set is `{1`}. To determine what the real
     *ambiguity is, we have to know whether the ambiguity is between one and
     *two or one and three so we keep going. We can only stop prediction when
     *we need exact ambiguity detection when the sets look like
     *`A={{1,2`}} or `{{1,2`,{1,2}}}, etc...
