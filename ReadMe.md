# TypeScript Runtime for ANTLR 4

This package started as a fork of the official ANTLR4 JavaScript runtime and has been fully implemented in TypeScript. It implements everything what the Java runtime does, except for the `UnbufferedCharStream` class, which requires a streaming source compatible with both Node.js and browsers. Other notable differences from the original JS source.

- Numerous bug fixes and other changes.
- No differentiation between node and browser environments.
- Includes the `antlr4ng-cli` tool to generate parser files compatible with this runtime. This tool uses a custom build of the ANTLR4 tool.

## Installation

To install the package, run the following command:

```bash
npm install antlr4ng
```

This package has a peer dependency to `antlr4ng-cli`, which is the tool to generate parser files compatible with this runtime, so it is strongly recommended to install this one too:

```bash
npm install --save-dev antlr4ng-cli
```
See [its readme](./cli/ReadMe.md) for more information.

If you come from one of the other JS/TS runtimes, you may have to adjust your code a bit. The antlr4ng package more strictly exposes the Java nullability for certain members. This will require that you either use the non-null assertion operator to force the compiler to accept your code, or you have to check for null values before accessing a member. The latter is the recommended way, as it is safer.

Additionally, some members have been renamed to more TypeScript like names. The following table shows the most important changes:

| Old Name | New Name |
| -------- | -------- |
| `Parser._ctx` | `Parser.context` |
| `Parser._errHandler` | `Parser.errorHandler` |
| `Parser._input` | `Parser.inputStream` |
| `Recognizer._interp` | `Recognizer.interpreter` |

The package requires ES2022 or newer, for features like static initialization blocks in classes and private fields (`#field`). It is recommended to use the latest TypeScript version.

## Usage

The following example shows how to use the runtime to parse a simple expression, assuming you have generated the lexer and parser files for the grammar and placed them in a subfolder folder called `generated`. The readme file of the [antlr4ng-cli](./cli/ReadMe.md) tool shows how to do that. Assume we have this expression grammar:

```antlr
grammar Expression;

start: multiply | divide | add | subtract;

expression: '(' expression ')' | number;

multiply: expression '*' expression;
divide: expression '/' expression;
add: expression '+' expression;
subtract: expression '-' expression;

number: NUMBER;

NUMBER: [0-9]+;
WS: [ \t\r\n]+ -> skip;
```

```typescript
import { CharStreams, CommonTokenStream } from "antlr4ng";
import { ExpressionLexer } from "./generated/ExpressionLexer.js";
import { ExpressionParser } from "./generated/ExpressionParser.js";

const input = "1 + 2 * 3";
const inputStream = CharStreams.fromString(input);
const lexer = new ExpressionLexer(inputStream);
const tokenStream = new CommonTokenStream(lexer);
const parser = new ExpressionParser(tokenStream);
const tree = parser.start();
```

You can then use the generated parser to walk the parse tree, for example with a visitor to evaluate the expression:

```typescript
import { ExpressionVisitor } from "./generated/ExpressionVisitor.js";

class MyVisitor extends ExpressionVisitor<number> {
  visitAdd(ctx: AddContext): number {
    return this.visit(ctx.expression(0)) + this.visit(ctx.expression(1));
  }

  visitMultiply(ctx: MultiplyContext): number {
    return this.visit(ctx.expression(0)) * this.visit(ctx.expression(1));
  }

  visitNumber(ctx: NumberContext): number {
    return Number.parseInt(ctx.NUMBER().text);
  }
}

const visitor = new MyVisitor();
const result = visitor.visit(tree);
```

## Tests and Benchmarks

This runtime is monitored for performance regressions. The times below were taken on a Mac Studio M1 Max with 32GB RAM (Sonoma 14.2).

### Running the Tests

There are a number NPM scripts in the project that are related to testing. The first step is the generation of the test parsers:

```bash
npm run generate-test-parsers
```

followed by the generation of the runtime tests:

```bash
npm run generate-runtime-tests
```

and the build of the package:

```bash
npm run build-minified
```

After that you can either execute different suites separately or as a whole.

|Test|Script|
|---|---|
|Unit tests|`npm run test`|
|Lexer speed test|`npm run time-lexer-speed`|
|Real world example|`npm run run-benchmarks`|
| All together|`npm run full-test`|

The unit tests consist of tests for individual classes in the runtime (API tests) and the runtime test suite ported from Java. They execute in about 10s.

### Runtime and API Tests

These are the original tests from ANTLR4, extracted and ported to TypeScript. The two parts are:

- API tests: unit tests for individual classes
- Runtime tests: integration tests that use descriptors for different grammars and specific input and expected output.

These tests together comprise 530 tests and run in 12.1s.

### Real World Example

The following tables show the results of the benchmarks previously run on the old JS runtime and on last release of this one. Warm times were taken from 5 runs with the 2 slowest stripped off and averaged.

Pure JavaScript release (with type definitions):

| Test | Cold Run | Warm Run|
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| Query Collection| 8464 ms | 230 ms |
| Example File | 1043 ms | 112 ms |
| Large Inserts | 11022 ms | 10616 ms |
| Total | 20599 ms | 10978 ms |

Last release (pure TypeScript):

| Test | Cold Run | Warm Run|
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| Query Collection| 6200 ms | 334 ms |
| Example File | 1069 ms | 194 ms |
| Large Inserts | 14472 ms | 14157 ms |
| Total | 21800 ms | 14709 ms |

The benchmarks consist of a set of query files, which are parsed by a MySQL parser. The MySQL grammar is one of the largest and most complex grammars you can find for ANTLR4, which, I think, makes it a perfect test case for parser tests.

The query collection file contains more than 900 MySQL queries of all kinds, from very simple comments-only statements to complex stored procedures, including some deeply nested select queries that can easily exhaust the available stack space (in certain situations, such as parsing in a thread with default stack size). The minimum MySQL server version used was 8.0.0.

The large binary inserts file contains only a few dozen queries, but they are really large with deep recursions, so they stress the prediction engine of the parser. In addition, one query contains binary (image) data containing input characters from the entire UTF-8 range.

The example file is a copy of the largest test file in [this repository](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/sql/mysql/Positive-Technologies/examples), and is known to be very slow to parse with other MySQL grammars. The one used here, however, is fast.

### Lexer Speed Test

Since the Java runtime tests have been ported to TypeScript there's another set of benchmarks, the lexer speed test. This set of tests was created when Unicode support landed in ANTLR4 and measures the speed of lexing different Unicode lexems in a lexer generated from the Java grammar.

The original Java execution times have been taken on OS X with a 4 GHz Intel Core i7 (Java VM args: `-Xms2G -Xmx8g`):

```bash
                loadNewUTF8 average time   356µs size  29191b over 3500 loads of 29191 symbols from Parser.java
                loadNewUTF8 average time    75µs size   7552b over 3500 loads of  7552 symbols from RuleContext.java
                loadNewUTF8 average time   122µs size  31784b over 3500 loads of 13379 symbols from udhr_hin.txt

             lexNewJavaUTF8 average time   641µs over 2000 runs of 29191 symbols
             lexNewJavaUTF8 average time  4987µs over 2000 runs of 29191 symbols DFA cleared

         lexNewGraphemeUTF8 average time 13537µs over  400 runs of  6614 symbols from udhr_kor.txt
         lexNewGraphemeUTF8 average time 13802µs over  400 runs of  6614 symbols from udhr_kor.txt DFA cleared
         lexNewGraphemeUTF8 average time 18762µs over  400 runs of 13379 symbols from udhr_hin.txt
         lexNewGraphemeUTF8 average time 18925µs over  400 runs of 13379 symbols from udhr_hin.txt DFA cleared
         lexNewGraphemeUTF8 average time   340µs over  400 runs of    85 symbols from emoji.txt
         lexNewGraphemeUTF8 average time   401µs over  400 runs of    85 symbols from emoji.txt DFA cleared
```

The execute times on last release of this runtime have been measured as:

```bash
                loadNewUTF8 average time   358µs size  29191b over 3500 loads of 29191 symbols from Parser.java
                loadNewUTF8 average time    74µs size   7552b over 3500 loads of  7552 symbols from RuleContext.java
                loadNewUTF8 average time   122µs size  31784b over 3500 loads of 13379 symbols from udhr_hin.txt

             lexNewJavaUTF8 average time   610µs over 2000 runs of 29191 symbols
             lexNewJavaUTF8 average time  4817µs over 2000 runs of 29191 symbols DFA cleared

         lexNewGraphemeUTF8 average time 12973µs over  400 runs of  6614 symbols from udhr_kor.txt
         lexNewGraphemeUTF8 average time 13151µs over  400 runs of  6614 symbols from udhr_kor.txt DFA cleared
         lexNewGraphemeUTF8 average time 18051µs over  400 runs of 13379 symbols from udhr_hin.txt
         lexNewGraphemeUTF8 average time 18228µs over  400 runs of 13379 symbols from udhr_hin.txt DFA cleared
         lexNewGraphemeUTF8 average time   329µs over  400 runs of    85 symbols from emoji.txt
         lexNewGraphemeUTF8 average time   387µs over  400 runs of    85 symbols from emoji.txt DFA cleared
```

## Release Notes

### 2.0.10

Fixed bug #26 getRuleContext is incompatible with generated code (2.0.5)

### 2.0.9

- Added exports for the profiling classes.
- Reverted some changes that failed the Java runtime tests.

### 2.0.8

- Fixed string construction with class names (which doesn't work when bundling the sources).

### 2.0.7

- Added an InterpreterDataReader implementation (copied from the vscode-antlr4 extension).
- Benchmark values listed here are now computed from 5 runs, instead just one.
- Added `RuleContext.toStringTree()` overload.

### 2.0.6

- Optimizations in HashMap and HashSet (from Peter van Gulik). This can have dramatic speed improvements, depending on the grammar. In the unit tests this shows mostly by a faster cold start.
- Added CommonJS builds back. Especially when running unit tests using Node.js a CommonJS variant is simpler to handle.
- Added clearDFA() methods in the simulators.

### 2.0.5

- Profiler port (from backspace <backspace@backblog.me>)
- Changed context getters in `ParserRuleContext` for retrieving sub contexts to accept any constructor parameter, for more flexibility.

### 2.0.4

- Code generation improvements, especially for local rule attributes. Attributes in a rule (which are implemented as local variables in the generated code) can be unassigned and need extra null-safety checks (the ? operator) or non-null assertions. The code generator now adds these checks automatically.
- `ParserRuleContext.getChild` now accepts any constructor type.

### 2.0.3

- Removed last reference to a Node.js specific type (Buffer), which avoids the automatic reference to the Node.js typings and an "resolution-mode" assertion for "require" (CommonJS).
- Upgraded the ANTLR4 jar, which now produces optional attributes in rule contexts.

### 2.0.1 - 2.0.2

- There are changes in the package content (typings are now in the dist folder too, instead of source).
- There are now index.ts files in every folder and used for the final export index.ts. This makes it easier to see if something is missing and to include new or renamed files.
- And there are some build changes/fixes as preparation for profiling the runtime.

### 2.0.0

The entire runtime now exclusively uses TypeScript. It was tested with the standard ANTLR4 runtime tests and completed the test suite successfully.

### 1.1.3 - 1.1.7

These releases contain mostly internal changes and bug fixes. The antlr4ng-cli tool dependency has been updated to the latest version and build + test processes has been improved (esbuild instead of webpack, Jest instead of Jasmine).

There are also some smaller fixes in `Interval` and `ParseTreeVisitor`. The latter now has the same implementation as the Java runtime.

- Fixed Bug #8 Wrong property name, using `numberOfSyntaxErrors` now.

### 1.1.1 - 1.1.2

Bug fix releases. They contain many bugs found while integrating the runtime into a large project.

### 1.1.0

This release includes a lot of cleanup.

- Generated parser rules that can appear as either returning a single parse context or a list of that no longer use the `__list()` appendix in their name. Instead method overloading is used now to distinguish between the two cases.
- The members `getTypedRuleContext` and `getTypedRuleContexts` have been renamed to `getRuleContext` and `getRuleContexts` respectively, just as in the Java runtime.
- There are more renames (`_errHandler` -> 'errorHandler`, `_input` -> `inputStream` and more).
- The package has been stripped down to just a single bundle file. This is an ESM module now, so it can be used in both, node and browser environments. No differentiation is made anymore between the two.
- The internal folder structure has been changed to match the Java runtime.
- Extended some classes, added new type definitions and exported some more classes.
- Improved `BitSet` to use less memory.

### 1.0.6 - 1.0.7

- Fixed recognizer token type and rule index maps.
- Fixed `getTokens()` in `BufferedTokenStream`.
- Added new peer dependency `antlr4ng-cli`, which is the tool to generate parser files compatible with this runtime.

### 1.0.5

- Added benchmarks.
- Introduced the `IntStream` interface as the base for `CharStream` and `TokenStream`. This avoids duplicate code in the stream type definitions.
- Removed `FileStream` as a preparation to get rid of the separate package files for node and browser. If something needs to be loaded from a file, the particular environment should provide the code for that.

### 1.0.2 - 1.0.4

- Github build action
- Updated package.json
- Exported `ErrorNode`, `InputMismatchException`
- Some smaller fixes

### 1.0.1

- Added and/or replaced all copyrights to a common ANTLR version.
- Removed all individual default exports. Only the final lib exports contain both, default and non-default exports. This avoids namespace access like `antlr4.atn`. Everything is available under a top level import.
- Renamed ErrorListener to BaseErrorListener, as that is what it is actually when comparing it to the Java runtime.

### 1.0.0

- Initial release.
